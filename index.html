                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello World! My name is Marshall Ferguson, and I am a passionate lifelong learner. I enjoy pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone, and my personal mission is to learn something new everyday. My current learning projects are web development, brazilian jiu-jitsu, and mixed martial arts.</p>
                <p>I got into web development originally through a class in college, and then through taking classes online on Treehouse. Currently, I am learning front end web development through Code Louisville, a local coding bootcamp program. I enjoy web development because it presents a fantastic opportunity to learn something new everyday, and it is a potential career field that I see myself enjoying. My goal is to start a career as a web developer in 2018.</p>
